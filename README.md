- [How to build a calculator by Doro Onome](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/building-a-calculator-a-javascript-project-for-beginners/) - This helped me in creating the logical workflow of how the calculator worked using ES6 concepts like classes and objects. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
